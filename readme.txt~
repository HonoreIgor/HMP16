1. Execution
   ---------
	
	Scripts and main files are made for UNIX system. If you have an other OS please, in the current directory, make a directory called "Result_density" and another "Result_nappe"; and proceed with 		your favorite compiler.
	For UNIX system here how to proceed:
	Check that you have the execution right of all scripts, otherwise use the command "sudo chmod +x [name_of_the_script]". 
	After that press the command "./[name_of_the_script]" to compile, and the command "./Source" is to execute it
	

2. Main Files
   ----------

In all files generated with values of function depending on a, the first column represent the values of a, the second one is the function.

	3.1 main_baised.cpp executed by Script_main_baised which generate a repertory ./Result_density
		Generate several files in the repertory ./Result_density: 
					a_n.data which is like in the article
					gamma0.data which is the optimized one
					m_theo.data which is the theoretical mean
					result.data which is all the realizations of the approximation of the invariant measure
					result_Gn.data which is all the realizations of the approximation of the invariant measure with a bais correction E_n^1
					result_corrected.data which is all the realizations of the approximation of the invariant measure with a bais correction E_n
					sigma_theo.data which is the theoretical variance
	
	3.2 main_dens.cpp executed by Script_main_dens , it needs files generated by main_baised.cpp to be filled
		Generate several files in the repertory ./Result_density: 
					Normal_result.data which is the asymptotic density with mean and variance are taken in the files m_theo.data and sigma_theo.data
					dens.data which is the density of the empirical measure
					dens_Gn.data which is the density of the empirical measure minus G_n
					dens_corrected.data which is the density of the unbaised empirical measure

	3.3 main_nappe.cpp executed by Script_nappe which generate a repertory ./Result_nappe
		Generate several files in the repertory ./Result_nappe:
					parabol.data which is the values of the function Sn(a)
					result.data which is the values of the function g_{n,\theta}(a)
					a_n.data which is the estimation of a_n for all differents theta of the nappe
					m_theo.data which is the theoretical mean
					sigma_theo.data which is the theoretical variance
					k0.data, k1.data ... the nappe values of g_{n,theta} for theta=theta_min+k/n*theta_max

	3.4 main_nappe.cpp executed by Script_nappe_supcobord_rho_optim, it needs Result_nappe/measure.data to be filled  
		Generate several files in the repertory ./Result_nappe:
					P_lambda_min_k0.data, P_lambda_min_k1.data ... the nappe values of P(\lambda_min), with rho optimization for theta=theta_min+k/n*theta_max

	3.5 main_meausre.cpp executed by Script_main_measure
		Generate several files in the repertory ./Result_nappe:
					measure.data the value of measure of a function choosen in the main
